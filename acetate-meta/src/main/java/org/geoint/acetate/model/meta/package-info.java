/**
 * This package provides a means to define a Model through the use of
 * annotations.
 * <p>
 * When available at build time, the {@link MetaModelProcessor} annotation
 * processor will create several model descriptor files within the resultant
 * jars META-INF directory. These files are then read at runtime to discover
 * model components by the {@link MetaAnnotationProvider}.
