/**
 * Data meta-model used by acetate to model the data components, constraints,
 * converters, etc of a specific data model and ultimately a data structure.
 * <p>
 * The acetate DataModel is a generic model of data, independent from any
 * existing standard, non-standard, structured, semi-structured and unstructured
 * data structures (POJO, XML, JSON, etc). The model simply defines the
 * components involved in the data structure.
 * <p>
 * The DataStructure ties the DataModel components together into a data
 * structure used to represent data.
